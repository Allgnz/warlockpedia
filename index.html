    <div class="title"> The Warlockopedia: A Comprehensive Warlock Handbook </div>
    <div class="subtitle">by Jasmine “Troacctid” Lawrence</div>

    <div class="introduction">

        <div>Hi! My name is Jasmine, and I'm here to talk about warlocks. (Specifically, warlocks in D&D 3.5e—if you're
            a 5e player, sorry, I'm sure there's another guide for that somewhere.)</div>
        <div>So. Here we are. Welcome to my Warlockopedia, a fully comprehensive handbook covering everything you need
            to know to play a warlock, whether you’re a newer player looking for advice and sample builds, a more
            invested player looking for fresh ways to optimize, or a grizzled veteran looking for a quick reference
            tool. The comprehensive nature of this handbook means that even non-warlocks should find it useful, too,
            particularly the sections on items, feats, templates, and Use Magic Device.</div>
        <div>The Warlockopedia is too large and complex to fit in the traditional handbook medium of a forum post, so it
            is presented here as a series of documents and spreadsheets (or this site). You can also view them as
            webpages (on the original document), which might
            display better for some devices.</div>

    </div>

    <div class="title">Introduction</div>

    <div class="heading">What is a Warlock?</div>

    <div class="what-warlock">

        <div>Story-wise, according to Complete Arcane, a warlock comes about when a powerful extraplanar entity, usually
            a
            chaotic and/or evil one, decides to bestow arcane might upon a mortal, giving them all sorts of dark and
            edgy
            powers. Later material backed off of the “dark and edgy” aspect somewhat, but warlocks are still required to
            be
            Chaotic or Evil, although you do not lose any class features if your alignment changes.

        </div>

        <div>The warlock class uses a form of innate magic known as invocations. Unlike other arcane spellcasters,
            warlocks
            don't have spell slots. Instead, all of their invocations are usable at will. Once you learn one, you can
            use it
            as much as you want without limit. The signature invocation of the warlock is eldritch blast, which allows
            you
            to deal a modest amount of untyped damage with a successful ranged touch attack. Other invocations are
            divided
            into least, lesser, greater, and dark invocations. You unlock a new category every 5 levels after 1st, and
            over
            the course of 20 levels, you end up getting 3 invocations from each category, plus detect magic and eldritch
            blast. Some invocations modify your eldritch blast, altering its properties to add additional bonuses and
            the
            like.</div>

        <div>Warlocks also have a natural knack for using magic items, gaining the ability to always take 10 on Use
            Magic
            Device checks at level 4 and the ability to bypass spell requirements for crafting magic items at level 12.
            Last and definitely least, warlocks have supernatural resilience, and gain small amounts of damage
            reduction,
            limited fast healing, and energy resistance, which helps a little bit to make up for the squishy d6 hit die
            they're stuck with, but not that much. Warlock base stats are like a slightly beefier sorcerer. You get a d6
            hit die, medium base attack bonus,
            good
            Will saves, and 2 + Int skill points per level. It's a pretty weak chassis. In particular, warlocks tend to
            be
            skill-starved, but we'll get to that later.</div>


        <div>Less experienced players and DMs sometimes balk at the warlock’s at-will abilities and overestimate the
            class’s
            power. This is an overreaction. Yes, they have an at-will attack, but so does any schmoe with a weapon, and
            the
            warlock’s doesn't deal a ton of damage. Yes, they have powerful utility abilities, but invocations are
            scarce
            and tend to be less individually powerful than the spells that traditional spellcasters unlock at the same
            level. On the whole, the class is actually pretty well-balanced against the rest of the game, and could even
            stand to be buffed a little bit. (For one thing, I’d definitely put them at 4 skill points and a d8 hit die,
            like dragonfire adepts.) In the most recent iteration of the tier system, the warlock landed into Tier 3,
            alongside classes like bard, duskblade, healer, swordsage, warmage, and wilder.</div>

    </div>

    <div class="playing-warlock">

        <div class="playing-content">

            <div class="heading">Playing a Warlock</div>

            <div class="text">The warlock play pattern has three pillars. The first is eldritch blast. This is the most
                visible and
                iconic feature of the warlock. You shoot lasers. Eldritch blast is a touch attack, so most enemies will
                have difficulty defending against it, and the damage is untyped, so energy resistance doesn't apply.
                Spell resistance can be an issue, but otherwise, you should have a pretty good hit rate. Your invocation
                options also include blast shape and eldritch essence invocations, which can modify your blasts, letting
                you attach rider effects or hit multiple targets or the like.

            </div>

            <div class="text">Bear in mind that eldritch blast does not naturally do a whole lot of damage (unless you
                sink a lot of
                resources into improving it). You're not a striker. What it does do is give you a consistent source of
                damage, turn after turn, so that you'll almost always be able to contribute in combat at least a little.
                For the most part, the addition of blast shapes and eldritch essences won't improve your damage all that
                much—at least not to striker levels—but with some investment, it can turn you into a reasonably potent
                support blaster, tagging multiple enemies at a time with debuffs while also taking bites out of their
                hit points.</div>

            <div class="text">(Side note: while eldritch blast is often thought of as a laser beam, it doesn't have to
                be. I’ve seen
                exploding flowers, eye beams, sword beams, rocket launchers, charged playing cards, Megaman-style arm
                cannons, cartoon hearts delivered by blowing a kiss, and least one walking Monty Python reference who
                summoned eldritch killer rabbits to run over and very briefly savage his enemies. Don't be afraid to
                give it your own flair. Warlock Concepts has some ideas to help inspire you.)</div>

            <div class="text">The second pillar is invocations. You don't get very many of them, but the ones you do get
                should have
                a high impact. You can fly, teleport, turn invisible, mind-control people, command undead armies, or
                whatever, and you can do it all day long, without any concern for conserving magical resources. This
                tends to make warlocks very good at solving whatever specific problem they specced for. For example, if
                you choose voracious dispelling as one of your invocations, you're gonna be really, really good at
                making unwanted spell effects go away. If you choose flee the scene, you can teleport your way past
                walls and obstacles with utter impunity. If you choose call of the beast, then you can talk with the
                animals, walk with the animals, and even grunt and squeak and squawk with the animals. However, because
                of your limited number of choices, you often end up having a very small toolbox with just a few really
                high-quality tools.</div>

            <div class="text">Invocations compete for space with eldritch blast upgrades. If you take a bunch of blast
                shapes and
                eldritch essences, you have less room for the powerful utility effects, and vice versa. Try and find a
                balance as best you can according to the needs of your party.</div>

            <div class="text">This brings us to the third pillar: Use Magic Device. Thanks to their 4th level ability,
                warlocks are
                exceptionally good at making use of wands, scrolls, and other magic items that would normally be
                restricted by class. It's important not to overlook this aspect of the class, because it goes a long way
                towards patching up your biggest weakness: inflexibility. Remember how I said you have a small toolbox?
                UMD allows you to make it a lot bigger. By stocking up on wands and scrolls of useful spells, you can
                vastly expand your options and make yourself a greater asset to your party. The level 12 crafting
                ability falls under this pillar as well, although because it comes online so late and is limited by feat
                selection, it's not quite as core to the class.</div>

            <div class="text">Oh, and you get some skills too, although not very many. Most warlocks should prioritize
                Concentration,
                Spellcraft, and Use Magic Device, but if you can find room, you might also have some social skills with
                Bluff, Intimidate, and/or Sense Motive, or some scholarly aptitude with Knowledge (arcana, planes,
                and/or religion).</div>

            <div class="text">As a whole, warlock is a relatively simple class to play. You can always pew-pew with
                lasers, and
                you have some other powers that tend to be fairly straightforward. It's hard to screw up too badly,
                because there's a natural baseline level of competency inherent in the progression. (Even if all
                you're doing is hitting a single target with touch attacks for a few d6 of damage a turn, you're
                definitely underperforming, but at least you're not totally useless). The trickiest bit is that
                third pillar. Magic items can really elevate your game if you use them effectively, but managing
                your wealth can require some finesse.</div>

            <div class="heading">Melee Warlocks</div>

            <div class="text">Warlocks can also function as melee brawlers via one of several methods. The hideous blow
                invocation
                allows you to add your eldritch blast damage to a melee weapon attack. The eldritch glaive invocation
                from Dragon Magic allows you to make a full attack in melee with your eldritch blast as if it were a
                reach weapon. The Eldritch Claws feat from Dragon Magazine #358 allows you to use a free action to
                change your eldritch blast into a pair of claws, which can be used as primary natural attacks and deal
                damage equal to your eldritch blast damage plus your unarmed strike damage. And finally, the somewhat
                dubious Grappling Blast feat, also from Dragon #358, allows you to discharge an eldritch blast along
                with each successful grapple check you make to deal damage.
            </div>

            <div class="text">If you invest in melee combat, you can achieve substantially higher single-target damage
                than your
                ranged counterparts, either by adding Strength and weapon bonuses with hideous blow, making multiple
                attacks with eldritch glaive, or a little of both with Eldritch Claws. I’ll cover some of these styles
                in bits and pieces elsewhere in the guide. <a
                    href="https://forums.giantitp.com/showthread.php?159708-Shinken-s-Guide-to-Melee-Warlocks&styleid=3">Shinken’s
                    Guide to Melee Warlocks</a> offers a more focused look
                into the topic.</div>

        </div>


        <div class="ability-scores">

            <div><a>Ability Scores</a></div>

            <div>Dexterity determines your attack bonus with your ranged blasts. Charisma determines the save DC of your
                invocations. Intelligence provides skill points. Constitution prevents you from dying to a stiff breeze.
                These are the four key ability scores that you want. Wisdom is not important. Strength is usually not
                important unless you’re a melee-focused build, in which case you probably want as much Strength as they
                can get, so basically Strength is going to either be your highest stat or your lowest. Which ability
                scores you prioritize will depend on your playstyle.

            </div>

            <div><strong>Strength</strong> allows you to use hideous blow or Eldritch Claws to smash faces in close
                combat. These builds
                can output more single-target damage than a traditional ranged warlock, but require more investment, and
                will put more pressure on your ability scores and feat slots. (Eldritch glaive also uses Strength, but
                only for the attack roll, not the damage, so you don't need it as much.) Make Strength your highest stat
                if you want to get up close and personal and don't mind building around that strategy.</div>

            <div><strong>Dexterity</strong> supports a blasting-based strategy. It improves your accuracy as well as
                your AC, initiative,
                and Reflex saves, making it useful for both offense and defense. Builds that center on eldritch blast as
                a ranged attack will usually have Dexterity as their highest or second-highest stat. All builds, of
                course, will still want as much Dexterity as they can afford.</div>

            <div><strong>Charisma</strong> is used for save DCs. Unlike traditional spellcasters, warlocks don't get
                bonus spells for a
                high ability score, nor do they need a minimum score in their key ability in order to cast spells, which
                means you don't necessarily need Charisma. If you aren't investing in social skills and none of your
                invocations require a saving throw, you can basically dump Charisma entirely (although it does still
                affect your Use Magic Device bonus). That said, there are quite a few powerful invocations that do allow
                a save. Without Charisma, it'll be that much more difficult to get any debuff effects to land.
                Accordingly, if you want to disrupt and debuff your enemies, Charisma should be either your highest or
                second-highest stat.</div>

            <div><strong>Intelligence</strong> provides you with additional skill points. This is important because
                warlocks really need
                those skill points. Concentration, Spellcraft, and Use Magic Device are baseline competencies for a
                warlock, and that's already more than your 2 per level. If you want to have access to knowledges and
                social skills and prestige classes without nerfing your skill-dependent class features, you're going to
                need a good Intelligence score. Making Intelligence your highest stat will give you greater versatility,
                enabling you to solve a wider range of problems for your party. Even if it's not your highest stat,
                higher is always better, because I guarantee you will never not want more skill points.</div>

            <div><strong>Constitution</strong> is never going to be a primary stat, but it is always going to be
                important, because out
                of all the ability scores, it's the only one that will straight up kill your character if you skimp too
                much on it. You don't want to get one-shotted by a lucky crit or a failed Reflex save. I usually make
                Constitution my second or third highest stat, and in point buy, I try to buy it up to 14 if possible.
            </div>

            <div><strong>Wisdom</strong> is a dump stat. You have a pact with an eldritch being from beyond the veil of
                reality. Sanity
                schmanity.</div>

        </div>



    </div>

    <div class="heading">Skills</div>

    <div class="what-warlock">It is a sad fact of the universe that there are never enough skill points, but few classes
        feel
        their absence so greatly as the warlock does. There are a lot of skills that you want, and you get a criminally
        low allotment of points to buy them with.
        <br>
        Skills in italics are trained-only.
    </div>

    <div class="title">Class Skills</div>

    <div class="skill-container">

        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: blue;">Bluff (Cha):</strong> A high Bluff skill can make you an
                all-star in social encounters. It turns out a
                lot of problems can be solved by lying, provided people believe you. Who knew? It’s fairly easy to
                outpace
                the Sense Motive checks of NPCs who don’t invest in it, and while it’s not ideal in the long-term
                (they’ll
                figure out they were duped eventually), it can bypass a lot of encounters while creating hilarious
                stories.
                There are also some relatively cheap ways to get very large bonuses to Bluff, like the glibness spell
                (+30),
                the conceal thoughts psionic power (+10), and the Spawn of the Dark Prince feat (+10).</div>
        </div>
        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: blue;">Concentration (Con):</strong> This is one of the most
                important skills for any caster.
                Concentration
                allows you to cast defensively to avoid attacks of opportunity if you get caught in melee, and it
                prevents
                you from losing your spell if you’re distracted or damaged during the casting. There will be a lot of
                fights
                where you never need to roll a single Concentration check and it doesn’t come up at all, but there will
                also
                be fights where you will waste your whole turn and be completely useless if you can’t hit a DC 20. You
                can
                risk it if you’re feeling lucky, but the bad scenario happens often enough and is so devastating that
                you
                really want to invest ranks here—at least enough to be able to reliably cast your invocations
                defensively.
                It doesn’t necessarily need to be maxed, and items like the tunic of steady spellcasting can help, but
                if
                you dump this skill, you do so at your own risk. Don't say I didn't warn you.</div>

        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: red;"> Craft (Int):</strong> Just buy the stuff, or hire an expert

            <div class="text"><strong style="color: red;"> Disguise (Cha):</strong> If you need to disguise yourself,
                it’s usually more efficient to rely on
                magic like disguise self. You shouldn’t be putting points into the skill itself unless you need it for a
                prerequisite e.g. for chameleon. Not that it doesn't have its uses occasionally, but it's clearly worse
                than
                Bluff and you're not made of skill points.</div>

                strategy, but it requires you to be in melee, so most warlocks won’t be able to use it effectively. The
                main
                combo is with frightful blast: hit them with the fear effect from your blast, then follow up with a
                demoralize (hopefully as a move action with fearsome armor or the Steely Gaze feat) to escalate them
                from
                shaken to frightened, forcing them to flee. The other use is with the Imperious Command feat, which
                causes
                them to cower for a round when you successfully demoralize them. As a social skill, though, I usually
                find
                Intimidate to be generally worse than Bluff, and you probably won’t have enough resources to take both.

            <div class="text"><strong style="color: red;"> Jump (Str):</strong> You could jump...or you could just fly
                or teleport instead. If you have a
                charger
                in your party, you can take 1 rank to help qualify your team for the Crowded Charge teamwork benefit
                (Player’s Handbook II), but that’s about the extent of the skill’s usefulness IMO.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><em><strong style="color: blue;"> Knowledge (arcana) (Int):</em></strong> This is the
                Knowledge skill that deals with constructs,
                dragons,
                and magical beasts, as well as general arcane magic stuff that isn’t already handled under Spellcraft.
                Magical beasts are reasonably common, and their abilities vary widely from beast to beast, so being able
                to
                identify them on sight is very valuable. Constructs are often a warlock’s bane, and knowing which ones
                are
                going to be immune to your abilities can save you from wasting your actions. Dragons aren’t as important
                to
                know about, since most of them fall under the umbrella of “Big flying reptile with natural attacks and a
                breath weapon,” but it can still be handy to know which element goes with which dragon. All told, Arcana
                is
                probably the most useful of all the Knowledge skills. I always try to fit in at least 5 points to get
                the
                synergy bonus to Spellcraft.</div>

            <div class="text"><em><strong style="color: blue;">Knowledge (the planes) (Int):</em></strong> This is the
                Knowledge skill that covers outsiders
                and
                elementals, as well as the overall nature of the cosmos. Outsiders, like magical beasts, vary widely in
                ability and appearance, so it’s useful to know what they can do, although they’re not usually as common
                in
                most campaigns (at least not until high levels). Elementals, you want to know the basic traits, but you
                can
                probably deduce most of the important stuff just by looking at them (“Fire hot. Water wet.” Etc.).
                Normally
                I’d value this skill lower than Arcana, but you need 12 ranks of it for hellfire warlock, one of the
                strongest warlock prestige classes, so it ends up showing up in more builds than it otherwise might.

            <div class="text"><em><strong style="color: blue;">Knowledge (religion) (Int):</em></strong> The only
                creature type covered here is undead, but
                undead are
                some of the most common evil minions around, so you'll see a lot of them in most campaigns, especially
                if
                you're doing a lot of dungeon crawls. Module writers love them because they represent unambiguously evil
                punching bags for the PCs to fight, and as a result, you can't walk through a sewer or a crypt or an
                ancient
                ruin without tripping over a dozen zombies, skeletons, or ghouls. Now, a little bit of Knowledge
                (religion)
                goes a long way, because half the battle is knowing the basic undead traits—but with more ranks, you'll
                also
                know things like whether this form of undeath is contagious (and if so, how to prevent its spread),
                whether
                this creature requires extra steps to lay it to rest permanently (and if so, what they are), and so on.

                people. It’s a solid social skill. It’s also
                not a very proactive one. If the other good skills are already covered by the rest of the party, I might
                invest in Sense Motive, but it’s hard to find space, and when skill points are tight, the “Nice to have”
                skills will always lose out to the “Must have” skills. If you happen to have Diplomacy, though, Sense
                Motive

            <div class="text"><em><strong style="color: blue;">Spellcraft (Int):</em></strong> This is the skill used
                for identifying magical effects. Since
                you have
                detect magic at will, you can bet you’ll be identifying a lot of magical effects, and the DCs can climb
                up
                pretty high, which means Spellcraft is at a premium. Also, this game just has a lot of spells in it, and
                even without detect magic, being able to know all the details of your enemies’ spells just by paying
                attention to components as they cast it is a major advantage that will serve you well over the course of
                your career. Furthermore, you need to make a Spellcraft check to identify scrolls before you can use
                them,
                so it’s an important complement to Use Magic Device. Oh, and it serves as the prerequisite to several
                nifty
                teamwork benefits. I think Spellcraft is one of the most important skills for a warlock, and I pretty
                much
                always try to keep it maxed.</div>

            <div class="text"><em><strong style="color: blue;">Use Magic Device (Cha):</em></strong> A core warlock
                skill. You need Use Magic Device in order
                to use some
                of your class features. Deceive item lets you take 10 on UMD, and imbue item lets you make a UMD check
                to
                bypass spell requirements when crafting magic items. Often, you’ll be looking to hit a specific DC here,
                with DC 20 for wands being the most common benchmark. But the DCs keep climbing up there—standard scroll
                DCs
                range from 21–37, for example—so you get more mileage by having a higher modifier. And if you have a
                familiar (which I recommend, since familiars are great), they share your ranks, but not your ability to
                take
                10, so you’ll want as many ranks as possible for their sake. In short, more is better, but you should at
                least have a high enough bonus to hit a DC 20 when you take 10.</div>

    <div class="skill-container2">
        <div class="skill">

            <div class="text"><strong style="color: red;"><em> Appraise (Int):</em></strong> I personally think Appraise
                is a little underrated, and I like to have the single rank to count as trained. But realistically, the
                benefit is marginal enough and the DCs low enough that there’s not much reason to invest any ranks
                beyond that. Maybe get a wand of appraising touch instead.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: blue;"><em> Autohypnosis (Wis):</em></strong> This skill (from
                Expanded Psionics Handbook) gives you perfect recall of a full page’s worth of text or symbols with a DC
                15 check. That’s not hard to hit (especially since 5 ranks in Concentration gives you a +2 synergy
                bonus), and memorizing stuff can come in handy. Autohypnosis checks can also help you stabilize more
                easily when you’re dying and retry saving throws against fear effects, both of which are valuable. A
                little investment here can go a long way, especially if you have the Able Learner feat.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: red;">Balance (Dex):</strong> Mostly useless. 5 ranks prevents you
                from being flat-footed while balancing, and 10 ranks allows you to use a Balance check to oppose a trip
                attempt (as per Rules Compendium page 145), but it’s cross-class, usable untrained, and becomes obsolete
                as soon as you gain the ability to fly, so, bleh.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: red;">Climb (Str):</strong> Like Balance, it quickly becomes
                obsolete once you can fly, but it’s actually even worse than that, because it also becomes obsolete once
                you can spider climb. And even if you can’t do either, the best climber in the party can usually go
                first and drop down a rope ladder to make it easy for everyone else. 👎</div>
        </div>
        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: red;"><em>Decipher Script (Int):</em></strong> This is the sort of
                skill that you might use once or twice in an entire campaign. It’s rarely ever called for, and is mostly
                useful for the +2 synergy bonus it adds to Use Magic Device checks involving scrolls, if that.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: blue;">Diplomacy (Cha):</strong> I’d call this an even more powerful
                social skill than Bluff. It’s exceptionally valuable for interacting with NPCs, and if you optimize for
                it, you can even use it mid-combat to pacify your enemies. Sadly, its cross-class nature makes it
                difficult to work with for most builds, but if you have the Able Learner feat or some way to make it a
                class skill, you can make it work.</div>

        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: red;"><em>Disable Device (Int):</em></strong> Even if you somehow
                had
                trapfinding, it would still be better to use magical means to bypass traps in most cases.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: red;">Escape Artist (Dex):</strong> Most warlocks dump Strength,
                which can make it difficult to avoid and escape grapples. Escape Artist can help—but if you don’t keep
                it maxed, then it will get outpaced by your BAB anyway. You should have a plan in place for if you get
                grappled, but for my part I prefer for that plan to be something like a ring of free movement or anklet
                of translocation.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: red;"><em>Forgery (Int):</em></strong> I still can’t believe there’s
                a whole skill for this. It’s bad, of course. If you need a forgery made, pay a hireling to do it. You'd
                have to be in a really specific campaign for this to be any good.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: red;">Gather Information (Cha):</strong> Sometimes this skill can
                help you uncover extra clues in an investigation, but the DCs are rarely high enough to reward any
                substantial investment, especially since you can use it untrained.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: red;"><em>Handle Animal (Cha):</em></strong> Okay, so here’s the
                thing about Handle Animal. It’s actually a pretty solid skill. You can get some pet dogs or a bird or
                whatever and train them into capable minions. Maybe you even find an abandoned wolf cub during your
                adventures and you rear it as a party mascot. But as a warlock, if that’s something you’re interested
                in, you can usually just take call of the beast as an invocation and make the whole skill pretty much
                irrelevant.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: red;">Heal (Wis):</strong> This skill is used for stabilizing dying
                characters and that’s basically it. Occasionally you'll diagnose a disease or learn the cause of death
                for a corpse. It can be used untrained and the DCs are low, so there’s not much reason to take ranks in
                it unless you’re trying to prestige into nosomatic chirurgeon.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: #ff00ff;">Hide (Dex):</strong> If this were a class skill, it would
                be very strong in combination with the Blend into Shadows feat, which allows you to make a Hide check as
                a swift action to hide in plain sight. As is, it’s actually surprisingly tricky to get it as a class
                skill without multiclassing (especially if you don’t have access to Dragon Magazine for the Flexible
                Mind feat), which means only dedicated stealth builds will get any use from it. If you can make it work,
                though, the payoff is there.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: red;"><em>Knowledge (architecture and engineering)
                        (Int):</em></strong> It’s not a monster knowledge skill and it’s frankly not very useful in
                general, outside of figuring out which walls in a structure are load-bearing. I’d honestly rather take
                Profession (architect) or Profession (engineer). At least it’s a class skill.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: black;"><em>Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int):</em></strong> This
                skill notably covers aberrations and oozes, both of which are nice to be able to identify, but its
                cross-class status makes it less appealing than arcana, planes, or religion.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: red;"><em>Knowledge (geography) (Int):</em></strong> It’s weird to
                me that this is its own skill instead of being part of Nature. Anyway, it’s one of the bad Knowledges,
                so skip it.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: red;"><em>Knowledge (history) (Int):</em></strong> While this one
                can actually give you useful information, I still don’t like it because of how easily a
                Knowledge-centric build could just take paragnostic apostle levels and get the Lore ability basically
                free, which does the same thing.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: #ff00ff;"><em>Knowledge (local) (Int):</em></strong> Outside of the
                Knowledge Devotion feat, you don’t usually have much call for a monster knowledge check relating to
                humanoids, which is what Knowledge (local) covers. They hardly ever have any special abilities that you
                care about, with the exception of obscure races like ushemoi. On the other hand, if you do have
                Knowledge Devotion, then this is one of the most important Knowledges because of how common it is to
                encounter humanoids.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: black;"><em>Knowledge (nature) (Int):</em></strong> Another solid
                monster knowledge skill, covering animals, plants, vermin, fey, giants, and monstrous humanoids. That’s
                a pretty wide selection. Like dungeoneering, it only really suffers from being cross-class.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: #ff00ff;"><em>Knowledge (nobility and royalty) (Int):</em></strong>
                The skill itself is pretty weak, but if you have 5 ranks, you get a +2 synergy bonus to Diplomacy.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: black;">Listen (Wis):</strong> Perception skills are valuable, but
                for the most part it’s not your job to be good at them. Make someone else do it. If nobody else wants to
                do it, then get a familiar to do it, or pick up serpent’s tongue as a least invocation and call it good.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: #ff00ff;">Move Silently (Dex):</strong> In a sense, it's better than
                Hide, because you can already get a zillion Hide by being invisible and/or small. In another sense, it's
                worse than Hide because the main draw to Hide is the Blend into Shadows feat, which doesn't reward you
                for Move Silently at all—which means it's conceivable that even some stealthy builds don't really need
                the skill.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: black;"><em>Open Lock (Dex):</em></strong> The skill itself is of
                limited use, especially if you take flee the scene to (essentially) ignore doors or pick up a couple
                scrolls or a wand of knock. However, taking a single rank is nice because just being able to count as
                trained is often good enough to unlock a door by taking 20, especially if you have a high Dex and some
                generic skill boosts.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: red;"><em>Perform (Cha):</em></strong> Useless except for
                prerequisites.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: red;">Ride (Dex):</strong> Mounted combat is usually not the
                warlock's forte, but it has its advantages. Those advantages generally don't require a ton of ranks in
                Ride, given how relatively rare it is to actually need better than a DC 5. As nice as it is to mount or
                dismount as a free action with a DC 20 check, I don't think it's worth investing in a cross-class skill.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: red;">Search (Int):</strong> Warlocks traditionally find traps with
                detect magic rather than with skill checks, so Spellcraft takes the place of Search. Likewise for many
                hidden items. Secret doors and clues and such, maybe not, but hopefully you can leave this particular
                job to the classes that have it as a class skill, or get detect secret doors via magic items. Or just
                don't worry about it. Either way, not worth investing in, outside of the rare multiclass rogue build.

        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: red;"><em>Sleight of Hand (Dex):</em></strong> This is a cool skill,
                but I think you need to invest a lot into it in order to use it reliably, and that isn't practical
                cross-class. Even if you get it as a class skill somehow, there will likely be better places to put your
                points. It's not a bad skill per se, but it's niche enough that it shouldn't be valued too highly.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: #ff00ff;"><em>Speak Language:</em></strong> Extra languages are very
                valuable if you're investing into Bluff or Diplomacy or just taking the charm invocation (which is
                language-dependent). Ideally, you want to handle the language barrier with magic, either telepathy or
                tongues. But if you prefer the old-fashioned way, there’s nothing wrong with dropping some points into
                Speak Language.</div>

        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: black;">Spot (Wis):</strong> See Listen.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: red;">Survival (Wis):</strong> Tracking is niche, navigating in the
                wilderness rarely matters, foraging for food is easy enough to do untrained, and intuiting directions
                and predicting the weather are cute but not important in the context of most adventures. It's not a
                useless skill, but there isn't much reason for you to care about it.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: red;">Swim (Str):</strong> While I appreciate the importance of not
                drowning, since it is definitely not the way a person who fights monsters for a living is supposed to
                die, spending cross-class skill ranks on Swim is not a good solution. Use items instead. An armor keel
                and some masterwork flippers will get you a +4 bonus pretty cheaply, which should be enough for a
                lightly armored character to avoid a watery grave. At higher levels, you can get a magic item that gives
                you a swim speed.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: black;"><em>Tumble (Dex):</em></strong> I really like the mobility
                offered by Tumble. Combat in this game tends to be “sticky”—if you’re in melee, getting out again can be
                difficult and painful. Tumble allows you to move around the battlefield without worrying about attacks
                of opportunity. That’s the sort of thing that’s especially convenient if you’re relying on ranged
                attacks as your primary combat strategy. 5-foot steps are a thing, of course, which means you don’t need
                Tumble, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t nice to have for the times when you need to move more than 5 feet
                at a time. Taking it cross-class isn’t really a good option, but if you have Able Learner, then sure.

            <div class="text"><strong style="color: black;"><em>Use Psionic Device (Cha):</em></strong> The psionic
                counterpart to Use Magic Device. It's fine, but UMD is better, and I'm skeptical of the value in
                investing in both. I suppose if you have Able Learner, you could do worse, especially if your DM is
                dropping psionic items as loot.</div>

        <div class="skill">
            <div class="text"><strong style="color: red;">Use Rope (Dex):</strong> I’m sure there’s three or four people
                in the history of D&D who have needed this skill at some point.</div>

        <div class="heading">Skill Tricks</div>
        <div class="text">Skill tricks were introduced in Complete Scoundrel and expanded on in Dragon Magazine
            #357. They can be purchased for 2 skill ranks if you meet the prerequisites, and they can be used once
            per encounter unless otherwise stated. A full list of skill tricks can be found in <a
                href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VSz3GaCBQeXsTWTSBppmd7J0qUBg19d1KaBGGwMeyZg/edit#gid=0">
                this spreadsheet</a>. As
            a general rule of thumb, most skill tricks are worth taking if you qualify for them, but few of them are
            worth going out of your way to get the prerequisites.</div>



        <div class="heading">Teamwork Benefits</div>
        <div class="text">Teamwork benefits are kind of like skill tricks, but for the whole party, and with no
            per-encounter limit. They appear in Dungeon Master’s Guide II, Dungeonscape, Forge of War, Heroes of
            Battle, and Player’s Handbook II. They usually have one prerequisite for the “leader” and a smaller
            prerequisite for other team members. A full list of teamwork benefits can be found in the <a
                href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VSz3GaCBQeXsTWTSBppmd7J0qUBg19d1KaBGGwMeyZg/edit#gid=0">
                same
                spreadsheet</a>. Unlike skill tricks, you’re more likely to go out of your way to qualify for a teamwork
            benefit, just because the team member requirements don’t require you to go as far out of your way. Talk
            with your party members about which teamwork benefits will be most useful for your team.</div>

        <div class="heading">Alternative Class Features</div>
        <div class="text">There are only two alternative class features for warlocks, both of which replace fiendish
            resilience.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="text"><strong style="color: red;"> Fiendish Flamewreath (PH2): </strong> Replaces fiendish
            resilience with a fire shield that damages anyone who attacks you in melee. The damage starts at 1d6 fire
            damage and increases at higher levels: 2d6 at level 13, and 5d6 at level 18. However, it remains usable only
            once per day. This is...maybe okay, I guess, assuming you're a melee warlock and you're already planning to
            be up close and personal. Even in the ideal scenario, though, I'm still not sure I wouldn't rather have the
            healing if I’m being hit multiple times like that. Like, even if the build already has fast healing from
            another source, multiple instances of it stack, so...meh. Just buy a crown of flames.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="text"><strong style="color: red;">Venomous Blood (DrU):</strong> Your blood is poisonous. At level
            8, you get +5 to saves against poison. At level 13, anyone who bites or swallows you is subject to a poison
            that deals 1d3 Strength damage, Fortitude DC 10 + half warlock level + Cha negates. At level 18, you can
            apply a more concentrated version of this poison to your eldritch blast or a held weapon attack 3 times per
            day; this takes a move action and increases the Strength damage to 1d6. I think this one is perhaps a bit
            cooler than the other one, but still not good.</div>
